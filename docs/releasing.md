# Releasing

Shoreline releases are driven from GitHub Actions through Cocogitto.

Use the **Release Plan** workflow in `plan` mode first. It reports the current commit, recent CI
status, the version Cocogitto will publish, and a changelog preview. For an exact release, set the
optional `version` input, for example `0.1.0`. After checking the plan, re-run the same workflow in
`release` mode with the same version input.

Release mode creates the Cocogitto version commit and tag, pushes both to `main`, and dispatches the
**Release** workflow for that tag. The Release workflow publishes the `shoreline` crate, then creates
the GitHub Release.

Before the first v0.1.0 publish, decide whether the crate should use a manifest `license` field or a
repository license file. Cargo package preflight currently passes, but warns when neither value is
present.

## Local helper

```sh
./scripts/run-release-plan.sh
./scripts/run-release-plan.sh plan 0.1.0
./scripts/run-release-plan.sh release 0.1.0
```

Set `RELEASE_PLAN_DIR=.` to keep the downloaded `release-plan.md`.

## Required repository setup

GitHub repository settings:

- Actions workflow permissions must allow **Read and write permissions**.
- Branch protection on `main` must allow this release workflow to push the Cocogitto version commit
  and tag, or the workflow must run with a token/account that is allowed to bypass the protection.

Repository secrets:

- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - crates.io API token with publish access for `shoreline`.
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` - private key used by the Release Plan workflow to sign the Cocogitto version
  commit and tag.

No Homebrew, npm, or binary-asset secrets are needed for Shoreline.

## Cocogitto Major Bumps

For normal automatic releases, Cocogitto infers a major bump from a breaking-change conventional
commit such as `feat!:` or a commit with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. For the first Shoreline `0.1.0`
release, use the explicit workflow version input instead of creating an artificial breaking-change
commit.
