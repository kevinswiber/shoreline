//! Served-asset contract for the inspector's URL-hash route grammar.
//!
//! The client has no JS execution harness (the served envelope is vanilla
//! `include_str!`'d assets with no bundler/test runner), so these guard the
//! durable, user-observable route-grammar tokens and behaviors over the
//! `Inspector` HTTP harness: the hash is the single serialization of view
//! state, distinct navigations push history while refinements replace it,
//! Back/Forward and manual hash edits both re-derive the view, and an absent
//! deep link falls back up the hierarchy with a visible diagnostic rather than
//! a 404 or a blank view. They assert stable route tokens and visible copy,
//! never private function names.
