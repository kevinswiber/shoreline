//! Served-asset contract for the inspector's single master-detail shell.
//!
//! The four parallel views collapse into one shell: a master pane that swaps
//! between the timeline / list / threads lenses, and a detail pane that is a pure
//! projection of the single selection. With no JS execution harness, these guard
//! the durable served markup (the one master + one detail pane, the lens
//! switcher, the absence of the four old view sections) and the preserved
//! advisory framing — never private render-function internals.
