# Intervention Model

## Status

V1 has a local durable intervention ledger. Shore can record `intervention_requested` events,
append `intervention_resolved` events, and expose polling read surfaces through
`shore review intervention list` and `shore review intervention fetch`.

This document remains architecture guidance for the model around that V1 surface. Prompt delivery,
watch mode, cancellation, escalation, final review dispositions, daemon behavior, and UI prompts are
deferred.

## Goal

Shore needs a durable way to represent moments where normal review flow should pause, ask for a
decision, surface an escalation, or record that outside input changed the path forward.

Do not call this "human-in-the-loop" in the core model. The actor may be a human, reviewer, monitor
process, automated tool, cloud worker, or another Shore client. The model should describe the
workflow fact, not assume who resolves it.

## Core Terms

- **Intervention:** a durable request for attention, decision, override, or acknowledgement.
- **Blocking intervention:** an intervention that should stop a cooperative client before it
  continues a workflow step such as publishing, applying notes, acknowledging review, pushing, or
  mutating state.
- **Advisory intervention:** an intervention that should be visible but does not block progress.
- **Resolution:** the durable answer to an intervention, such as approved, rejected, dismissed,
  superseded, or resolved by a later event.
- **Cancellation:** withdrawal of an intervention request before a decision is made, usually because
  the request was mistaken, superseded, or no longer relevant.
- **Escalation:** a higher-priority intervention, usually created because the original workflow
  cannot decide safely from local state.

## Architectural Principles

Interventions are durable events, not UI prompts. A TUI may render an intervention as a modal, a CLI
may print it to stderr, and a monitor may react in real time, but the durable model should be the
source of truth.

Interruption should be cooperative. Shore does not need to preempt another process mid-operation.
Clients should check durable state at safe boundaries and decide whether unresolved blocking
interventions require them to pause.

The model must support both real-time and polling clients:

- A monitor-style client can subscribe to stdout/stderr, filesystem notifications, or a future event
  stream and respond quickly.
- A turn-boundary client can poll at start, stop, or before risky operations.
- A cloud client can poll or receive backend-specific notifications without changing the event
  vocabulary.

The same durable event model should work for all three.

## Event Model

V1 intervention events use the same event envelope as other review/session state:

```text
intervention_requested
intervention_resolved
```

Deferred event types may include:

```text
intervention_cancelled
intervention_escalated
```

`intervention_requested` records the durable request. The request has a stable intervention ID, a
target reference, a required track, a blocking/advisory mode, a short title, an optional body, and a
structured `reasonCode`.

`intervention_resolved` records a durable answer. The resolution has a stable resolution ID, targets
the intervention, and carries an `outcome` such as approved, rejected, dismissed, superseded, or
abandoned. Resolution `outcome` is intentionally separate from request `reasonCode`: one describes
why the pause was requested, the other describes how it ended.

V1 resolution events keep the request event's review unit, revision, snapshot, and track context.
That anchors the decision to the captured material that caused the intervention, not to whatever
worktree state happens to exist when the intervention is resolved.

Multiple different resolution events are preserved as append-only facts. Current V1 read surfaces
report that state as ambiguous rather than choosing a timestamp winner.

Future `intervention_escalated` should target an existing intervention and change its routing or
urgency in the derived projection. It should not create a second intervention. If a separate decision
is needed, create another `intervention_requested` event with an explicit relationship to the first.

Future `intervention_cancelled` means the request was withdrawn without a decision. V1 expresses
cancellation-like outcomes through `dismissed`, `superseded`, or `abandoned` resolution outcomes.

Each event should carry:

- a stable intervention ID
- target reference: ReviewUnit, file, range, observation, intervention, or event
- blocking/advisory mode
- request reason code
- short title
- body or structured details
- requesting actor or writer provenance
- resolving actor or writer provenance, for resolution events
- timestamps using the same UTC timestamp policy as other Shore events
- idempotency key

Reason codes should stay workflow-oriented, not actor-oriented. Useful starting categories:

- `ambiguous_state`
- `unsafe_action`
- `stale_revision`
- `failed_gate`
- `external_side_effect`
- `conflicting_event`
- `missing_permission`
- `manual_decision_required`

The `blocking` mode is the control-flow signal. Urgency is advisory; it should not decide whether a
client may continue.

Interventions should not expire automatically. Clearing an unresolved intervention requires an
explicit `intervention_resolved` event in V1, or a future `intervention_cancelled` event. A future
`expiresAt` field can be added if a concrete workflow needs advisory expiry, but it should not
silently unblock a client.

Every blocking intervention must have a defined exit event or escalation policy. That does not mean
blocking states should clear themselves on a timer. For review workflows, the external decision is
often the point. The requirement is that Shore can represent how the state ends: resolved,
cancelled, superseded, escalated, or explicitly abandoned.

Resolution events should preserve the audit trail even when the target is no longer live. For
example, an `intervention_resolved` event targeting a closed work unit should still be recorded, but
any resume or apply action derived from it should be a no-op. Distinguish "the event happened" from
"the action still applies."

## V1 Commands And Derived State

The command surface is:

```bash
shore review intervention request
shore review intervention list
shore review intervention fetch
shore review intervention resolve
```

The V1 read surface is polling-oriented. `list` and `fetch` replay `.shore/events/`; they do not
depend on `state.json` as authority. Bodies and resolution reasons may use internal
`shore.note-body` artifacts, but command output does not expose artifact paths.

Bounded `state.json` exposes only summary counters:

```text
interventionCount
openInterventionCount
openBlockingInterventionCount
```

A future fuller projection can expose:

```text
unresolved_interventions
unresolved_blocking_interventions
latest_intervention_event_id
```

A client should be able to ask:

- Are there unresolved blocking interventions for this work unit?
- Are there unresolved blocking interventions targeting the current revision?
- Has anything changed since my last event cursor?
- Which event or artifact caused the intervention?

That implies Shore should eventually expose an `events_since(cursor)` style API or equivalent
cursor-based projection. V1 does not implement that API, but it should not choose a storage shape
that makes it awkward.

## Design Constraints For Local Durable State

The local durable-state model should preserve these future requirements:

- Use generic target references in event payloads rather than hard-coded single-target fields.
- Keep event IDs and idempotency keys stable enough for polling clients.
- Keep derived `state` rebuildable from durable events.
- Do not make terminal UI state the only place an interruption can live.
- Do not assume intervention actors are humans.
- Do not assume intervention delivery is real-time.
- Do not assume local filesystem notification is available.
- Do not require async storage yet, but avoid event semantics that depend on POSIX-only behavior such
  as atomic rename; remote backends may need conditional create, versioned writes, or transactions.
- Re-read target state before applying a resolution or resume action; stale targets should preserve
  the event but suppress the action.

Intervention transport is independent of review-exchange transport. An intervention is not a review
artifact, verdict, or review note. A future adapter may export or import intervention facts, but the
core model should keep them separate.

## Non-Goals

This document does not require:

- a prompt system
- a daemon
- a notification service
- a lock or lease protocol
- a cloud backend
- a TUI modal
- note mutation
- an acknowledgement command

Those may become useful later, but the architectural requirement is narrower: Shore's durable model
should be interruptible at safe workflow boundaries.
